"Jeff Connelly covers a few more terms in his 2008 paper “Ternary Computing Testbed 3-Trit Computer Architecture.” A “trit” is the ternary equivalent of a bit. If a bit is a binary digit that can have one of two values, then a trit is a ternary digit that can have any of three values. A trit is one base-3 digit. A “tryte” would be 6 trits. Connelly (and perhaps no one else) defines a “tribble” as half a trit (or one base-27 digit) and he calls one base-9 digit a “nit.” (For more on data measurement, see Understanding Bits, Bytes and Their Multiples.)

It can all become a bit overwhelming,, so we’ll just look at another concept to help us get a grasp of the numbers. Ternary computing deals with three discrete states, but the ternary digits themselves can be defined in different ways, according to Connelly:

Unbalanced Trinary — {0, 1, 2}
Fractional Unbalanced Trinary — {0, 1/2, 1}
Balanced Trinary — {-1, 0, 1}
Unknown-State Logic — {F, ?, T}
Trinary Coded Binary — {T, F, T}"

# My Opinion
We use binary computers these days, but why don't we choose the Ternary Computers? The reasons behind are complicated. But the Ternary Computers can work perfectly and the reasons why it works are also interesting.
